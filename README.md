üõ†Ô∏è Hosting a Django Web Application on AWS EC2

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to deploy a Django web application on an AWS EC2 instance.

üìå Prerequisites

‚úÖ An AWS account‚úÖ A running EC2 instance (Ubuntu recommended)‚úÖ SSH access to the EC2 instance‚úÖ A registered domain (optional but recommended)‚úÖ Security group configured to allow HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) traffic

üöÄ Steps to Host Django on AWS EC2

1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect to EC2 Instance

Use SSH to connect to your EC2 instance:


2Ô∏è‚É£ Update and Install Dependencies

Ensure your system is up to date and install required dependencies like Python, pip, virtualenv, and Git.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Clone Your Django Project

Pull your project from a Git repository or upload your application files.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a Python virtual environment, then install dependencies from your requirements file.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Database

Set up and configure a database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL, updating Django's settings.py accordingly.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Gunicorn as WSGI Server

Install and set up Gunicorn to serve your Django application.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Nginx as a Reverse Proxy

Install and configure Nginx to forward requests to Gunicorn.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Firewall and Security Groups

Ensure that your security groups allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic and configure ufw if needed.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up a Domain Name (Optional)

Use a domain registrar to point your domain to the EC2 instance and configure an SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt.

üîü Set Up Systemd for Process Management

Create a systemd service to keep Gunicorn running and automatically restart it if needed.

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Environment Variables

Set up .env files or use AWS Secrets Manager to securely store sensitive information like database credentials and secret keys.

1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Automate Deployment (Optional)

Use CI/CD pipelines, AWS CodeDeploy, or Ansible to automate future deployments.

üéØ Conclusion

Following these steps, you can successfully deploy and host a Django web application on AWS EC2. Be sure to secure your application and monitor server performance for smooth operations.
